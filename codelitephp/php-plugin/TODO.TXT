Code Completion / Code Generation
=================================

- code completion: member is not recognized when placed after a class constant
- code completion: better comment for ctor/dtor functions
- code completion: add a menu option for a class to implements all its parent interface functions
- code completion: add ctor function calltip... (its annoying!) NOTE: __constuct is not called by default. Only the child __construct should be called
- When typing inside 'require{_once}' auto complete file names
- code completion: add option to 'add include for ...'
- Must: SFTP: add a per file destination folder to allow overriding the global settings
- Better parsing for functions' return value
- Navigation Bar
- Code Formatter based on phptidy

Usability:
==========

- Restore last session
- Function calltip should include the return value
- Allow user to define a deployment folder for his files 
  (in addition to the SFTP, it should also allow user to copy files by simply saving them)
- XDebug analysis (help the user configure xdebug on his box)
- Auto detect Zend Server if installed

*********************************************************
    Implement the following checks before debug session 
    starts:
    - Zend Debugger is _NOT_ enabled
    - XDebug _is_ loaded
    - xdebug.remote_connect_back=1
    - xdebug.remote_enable=1
    - Check that the XDebug port is available
    - idekey _is_ set
*********************************************************

NICE TO HAVE: 

- Watches
- Workspace view: make it multi selection
